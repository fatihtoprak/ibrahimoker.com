                <p>Welcome. I am Assistant Professor of Politics and International Affairs at the Department of Politics and the School of
                Public and International Affairs at Princeton University.</p>
                
                <p>I study the international and domestic politics of statebuilding and state capacity. Much of my work examines how
                external actors disrupt political order and shape the development of the state. My research interests also include the
                historical and domestic determinants of state development and the politics of territorial change.</p>
                
                <p>My first book, Crippling Leviathan: How Foreign Subversion Weakens the State, is now available from Cornell University
                Press. My research has also been published in the American Journal of Political Science, Journal of Politics, and
                International Organization, and my policy writing has appeared in Foreign Affairs. My work has received the American
                Political Science Association‘s 2016 Helen Dwight Reid (now Merze Tate) award and Perry World House‘s Emerging Scholar
                Global Policy Prize.</p>
                
                I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from Stanford University and my B.A. in Political Science from the University
                of California, San Diego. Prior to joining the faculty at Princeton, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at Stanford
                University‘s Center for Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law. In AY20-21, I will be in residence at the
                University of Pennsylvania as the Perry World House Lightning Scholar.</p>
